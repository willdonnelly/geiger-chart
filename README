This is a quick standalone script I wrote to read the output of the Sparkfun Geiger Counter
via serial, count the number of events per minute, and generate a plot of the last N such
counts as a PNG.

I don't actually own a geiger counter so I have no idea how well it works with the real thing,
but the plotting code definitely works.
